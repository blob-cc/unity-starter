# Unity Creative Coding Template

Unity is a powerful game engine and development platform that can also be used for creative coding projects. With a robust set of built-in tools for 3D graphics, physics, and interactivity, Unity provides a solid foundation for creating unique interactive experiences, installations, and virtual environments.

This Unity project is a template for creative coding and generative art. It includes a variety of utility scripts, custom data structures, and settings optimized for quick prototyping and development of artistic projects.

## Features

- **Modular Scripts**: A collection of scripts for handling input, generating patterns, managing shaders, and more.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Grid, binary tree, linked list, stack, and queue implementations.
- **Shader Effects**: Utility functions for creating and manipulating shader-based effects.
- **Pattern Generators**: Tools for generating geometric patterns, grids, circles, and spirals.
- **Noise Generators**: Perlin and Simplex noise generators for procedural content creation.
